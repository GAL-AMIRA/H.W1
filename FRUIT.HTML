          <p>
            Kiwifruit (often shortened to kiwi in Canadian, American, British and continental European English) or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia . The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg. It has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavor.

          <h2>Planting Advice</h2>
          <img src="image/Planting Advice.jpg" alt="Planting Advice"/>
          <p>Favourable planting conditions are essential, particularly as kiwi plants become established, because they can be quite fussy. The vines need plenty of sunlight and shelter to survive, so choose a south-facing site shielded from low winter and early spring sun by buildings or trees. Kiwis also require a fertile, well-drained, acidic soil rich in organic matter; we do not recommend planting in poor or chalky soils. If you're soil doesn't drain well, plant each vine atop a raised mound of earth to avoid the top part of the root system sitting wet. Kiwis require plenty of space - allow a minimum of 3 and up to 4.5 meters if possible. They are suitable for container growing, which is normally the preferred option if ground conditions are not quite perfect, as container grown specimens can then be planted out once 4-5 years old when less fussy about the soil conditions. Container grown plants will also demonstrate very rapid growth if carefully watered and regularly fertilised; just ensure they are not over-fertilised before the winter cold as late new growth will be more vulnerable to the frost. Planting is best undertaken between late autumn and early spring.

          <h2>WHY THEY ARE CALLED KIWI</h2>
          <img src="image/kiwibird.jpg" alt="kiwibird" />
          <p>The original Chinese name for the kiwi is Míhóutáo, which translates to Macaque Peach in English. Rhesus macaque monkeys are native to the Yangtze Valley, and as enthusiastic fruit eaters, they are very fond of the native kiwis that grow there. In New Zealand, the fruit was initially referred to as the Chinese Gooseberry, because it reminded locals of another delicious fruit at the time.⁴But, this name was an issue. The period in which kiwifruit increased in popularity was also the era of drive-in movies, poodle skirts, soda fountains, and Elvis.
            Back when racism was more of an inner dialogue and less a political platform. 
            Because it was the Cold War, the name Chinese gooseberry had major commie vibes! And as the popularity of the fruit grew, so did the desire for a shorter and sweeter name. Eventually, growers settled on the name kiwi as an homage to New Zealand’s growing regions and the small, fuzzy, flightless bird endemic to the island.⁷
            Many anglophone nations call it a kiwifruit to differentiate it from the bird. Sadly for Americans, we don’t have kiwi birds running around, so we haven’t felt the need to disambiguate the word
